# Pyng Pong
This project is a simple yet complete implementation of the classic Pong game in python using the pygame library.

## Inspiration
Well, games are fun to program! :satisfied:

## Usage
To play the game, just run the *main.py* script in a terminal by using the command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Just make sure you have pygame installed, otherwise you can install it using the command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
## Commands
Press the UP and DOWN keys to move your paddle. The game has no end, but you can press the 'q' key to quit the game.
