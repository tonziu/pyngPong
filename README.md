## Usage
To play the game, just run the *main.py* script in a terminal by using the command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Just make sure you have pygame installed, otherwise you can install using the command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
## Commands
Press the UP and DOWN keys to move your paddle, while it moves you can press the ctrl key to move it faster! The opponent will try to beat you. The first one to reach seven points wins, have fun!
